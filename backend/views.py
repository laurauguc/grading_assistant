    "1. Validate the grading task:\n"
    "   - Ensure the student submission is a valid assignment and not a variable or hypothetical input or the word 'input' or related words.\n"
    "   - Ensure the student submission aligns with the grading rubric.\n"
    "   - Check for any issues such as very short essays, off-topic content, inappropriate or violent content, or missing information.\n"
    "   - If issues are found, stop grading and output the issue(s).\n"
    "2. Grade the student submission and provide a justification:\n"
    "   - Assign an overall score as well as scores for each criteria in the grading rubric.\n"
    "   - Identify both strengths and weaknesses, giving special emphasis to areas of excellence.\n"
    "   - Provide specific justification based on the grading rubric and the student submission.\n"

    "   - Ensure all justifications are factually accurate.\n"
    "   - Reassess if the grading was too tough. Consider assigning higher points for effort and creativity.\n"
    "   - Verify that all grading rubric criteria are included and sum correctly to the total score.\n"
