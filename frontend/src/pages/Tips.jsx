                  <strong>Understand the App’s Limitations:</strong>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Be Aware of “Hallucinations”: </strong> GradeMate
                      is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of
                      Artificial Intelligence model. As is common with LLMs, it
                      may sometimes generate incorrect or irrelevant information
                      that looks feasible (called “hallucinations” in AI
                      jargon). Always review the grades and feedback provided by
                      the app to ensure accuracy and relevance.

                      <strong>College Graduate Analogy: </strong> Think of
                      GradeMate as a “fresh college grad.” As a recent college
                      graduate, GradeMate has general background knowledge but
                      does not have specialized training in your subject. It
                      also has no memory of previous assignments (think of a
                      different college grad grading each assignment).
                      Therefore, expect some variations in grading and
                      limitations in uncovering specialized ideas and concepts
                      (such as a poem with intricate hidden meanings and
                      intentional but subtle misuse of conventions; though
                      sometimes it can interpret these). In other words,
                      GradeMate can effectively apply the poetry grading rubric
                      to a high school poem but is more limited in discovering
                      the brilliance in T.S. Eliot’s poems.{' '}

                      GradeMate is built on LLMs, which can reflect systematic
                      biases present in the data used to train them. While
                      overcoming these biases is an active area of research,
                      LLMs can still be subtly affected by them. To ensure
                      fairness and inclusivity, we encourage you to review the
                      app’s output critically, particularly when grading or
                      providing feedback on sensitive topics or diverse

                      better suit their individual needs and context.

                      'Additional Instructions’ settings (step 3 in Home tab) to
                      calibrate the grading process according to your specific
