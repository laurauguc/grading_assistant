      <h1>Welcome to GradeMate.</h1>
      <p>
        GradeMate harnesses cutting-edge advancements in Artificial Intelligence to support teachers and students in grading writing assignments and delivering personalized feedback. Our mission is to reduce teacher burnout and mitigate shortages by streamlining one of the most time-consuming tasks in education, while enhancing formative feedback quality.
      </p>
      <p><span className="boldLight">Important:</span> GradeMate is not a substitute for human judgment. Teachers must critically evaluate all AI-generated feedback before using it with students. (<em>See the RESPONSIBLE USE tab for more details.</em>)</p>

      <h2>üí° Our Vision & the Current State of AI in Education</h2>
      <p>No current AI tool is suitable for fully automated grading due to the limitations outlined in the RESPONSIBLE USE tab. <span className="boldLight">Human oversight and final judgment remain essential.</span></p>
      <p>In the future, AI may support limited forms of automated grading‚Äîfor example, in basic or diagnostic assessments‚Äîbut such use must be approached with caution. Any implementation must be guided by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparency</li>
        <li>Research-based practices</li>
        <li>Fairness and accountability</li>
        <li>Student rights to review and appeal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This open-source project‚Äî<a href="https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code available here</a>‚Äîaims to spark conversation around the future of AI in grading, its limitations, and ethical use. This work began at <span className="boldLight">Conlumbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences Innovation Lab (QMSS Innovation Lab)</span> and we hope to expand collaboration with the wider research and educational community.
        We welcome you to engage in discussions at this <a href="https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> link</a>.

      <h2>üë• Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        We are a passionate team of students and professionals brought together through the QMSS Innovation Lab. Our diverse backgrounds in the humanities, social sciences, and data science enable us to tackle AI-powered grading with an interdisciplinary approach.

      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Risks of AI-Supported Grading</h2>
      <p>
        AI-supported grading is not the same as automated grading‚Äîit is a <span className="boldLight">teacher-led</span> process. However, educators must be aware of potential risks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span className="boldLight">Moral Deskilling:</span> Overreliance on AI outputs can cause teachers to disengage from the ethical and reflective aspects of their feedback responsibilities.</li>
        <li><span className="boldLight">Bias and Marginalization:</span> Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on dominant linguistic patterns. As a result, they may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes and overlook or penalize minority or subtle perspectives.</li>
        <li><span className="boldLight">Inaccurate Outputs:</span> AI-generated content may include plausible but incorrect information‚Äîoften called ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù However, this term can be misleading, as it anthropomorphizes AI and implies reasoning or understanding where none exists.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>üåü Benefits of AI-Supported Grading</h2>
      <p>
      <span className="boldLight">The potential benefits of AI-assisted grading compel us to explore its development and responsible implementation.</span> Currently, grading writing assignments consumes nearly{' '}<a

          <h3>Fostering Teacher-Student Interaction</h3>
          <p>
            A teacher‚Äôs time is invaluable. Supporting grading tasks frees up teachers to engage more
            directly with their students. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon which
            you can use to change the world.‚Äù The aim is allowing teachers to have <span className="boldLight">more time to
            focus on the interactions that shape students' lives.</span>

          <h3>Enhancing Writing Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            With the help of AI-powered grading tools that incorporate feedback capabilities, teachers can offer more detailed and targeted responses on writing assignments. These tools can highlight strengths, pinpoint areas for improvement, and provide clear reasoning along with illustrative examples.
            Ideally, such tools would go beyond simply recommending feedback; they would <span className="boldLight">actively collaborate with teachers to deepen their insights</span>. Features like ‚ÄúRewrite with AI,‚Äù ‚ÄúConnect to Study Materials,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdd Examples‚Äù could help educators further refine and enrich their comments.
