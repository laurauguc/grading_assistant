# <img src="./frontend/src/images/logo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/> GradeMate

The AI-powered Grading Assistant Application, GradeMate, aids teachers in grading written work. Teachers can apply curated rubrics or upload their own. The most recent version of this app is available at: [www.grade-mate.app](https://laurauguc.pythonanywhere.com).

## Architecture

GradeMate is built using JavaScript for the frontend and Python for the backend. Specifically, the frontend is a ReactJS app while the backend is a Django app, functioning as an API endpoint for the frontend.

## Requirements

The required programming languages are Node.js and Python. Versions used: Python 3.12.3, Node v22.3.0, npm 10.8.1.

For installation of JavaScript and Python dependencies, see the setup instructions below.

## Set-Up Instructions

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

  1.A. Using the command line, install virtualenv:

  ```console
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

  Note: if using Homebrew to manage packages, the command is likely `brew install virtualenv`.

  1.B. Create a virtual environment by first navigating to the project folder and then running this command:

  ```console
  virtualenv venv
  ```

  This command creates a virtual environment called "venv" contained in the homonymous folder. By using the same name for the virtual environment, git will know to ignore it (since it's listed in the .gitignore file).

  1.C. Activate the virtual environment:

  ```console
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

2. Create and store the GOOGLE_API_KEY.

  Obtain a Google API KEY here: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)


3. Prepare the _.env_ file

  Create a Django secret key by running the following command.

  ```console
  python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
  ```

  Create a _.env_ file in the project directory. Add the required environment variables:

  ```txt
  GOOGLE_API_KEY="<Insert-API-Key-here>"
  DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="<Insert-Django-Key-here>"
  DJANGO_DEBUG="True"
  SECURITY_SETTINGS="False"
  ```

4. Install dependencies.

  Using npm for JavaScript dependencies, from the frontend directory:

  ```console
  npm install
  ```

  Using pip for Python dependencies, from the project directory:

  ```console
  pip install -e .
  ```

5. Run the development servers.

  To start the Django backend:

  ```console
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

  For the ReactJS frontend (from the frontend directory):

  ```console
  npm start
  ```
  Note: Since the two development servers need to run a the same time, open each in a separate terminal.

7. View the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Tips for deployment

Before running the code on a live website, use the _.env_ file on the host server to turn on the security settings and turn off the Django debug mode.

_.env_ file:
```txt
DJANGO_DEBUG="False"
SECURITY_SETTINGS="True"
```

## Deployment

To avoid installing Node.js on the app's hosting server, it is possible to use the static files generated from running `npm run build` locally. Since running the build locally does not allow accessing environment variables from the host server, we added a _frontend/src/config.json_ file to store the URL of the host server. This is needed by the frontend to make API requests to the backend.

The script _prepare_static_for_hosting.py_ automates the steps to obtain and collect required static files, including obtaining the host base URL, running the ReactJS build, and collecting Django static files. If hosting on a different site, the URLs specified in the script for the development and production sites need to be updated accordingly.

## Additional Instructions

### (Optional) Modifying the _db.sqlite3_ database

The recommended way to modify the database is through the admin site. Make sure that the backend server is running, and then, from a browser, navigate to the admin site: http://localhost:8000/admin. The admin site allows both viewing and modifying the data. It also allows managing users and user group authentication and authorization.

It is also possible to view and modify the _db.sqlite3_ database with a database browsing App, such as DB Browser for SQLite (downloadable here: https://sqlitebrowser.org/). However, using the admin site is recommended.

### (Optional) Replacing the _db.sqlite3_ database with other external data

The developer can also replace the existing _db.sqlite3_ database with new data in the format expected by the _backend/management/commands/load_grading_rubric_data.py_ file.

To run this loading function, first delete the _db.sqlite3_ database and then run the following command.

```console
python manage.py load_grading_rubric_data
```

Note: As of release 0.0.1, the _load_grading_rubric_data_ module assumes a specific location for the _rubrics_data_for_loading_ directory. Adjust path in script accordingly.

To migrate the database and set-up an admin account, please consult Django documentation.
